Advent of Code
==============

I've been working Advent of Code for a few years to
as a relaxing passtime, and as a vehicle to learn new kanguages. 
I don't try to do them quickly or keep up with the 
competitive programmers so no solutions will be posted
here before the leaderboard of AoC is long past full. 

Solutions are in whatever language i was interested
in at the time -- and often in several. 

most common are:
python, julia, elixir, lua, janet (a lisp dialect )
Some in gforth, rust, some in Go, maybe a few in JavaScript 

Many thanks to Eric Wastl who runs AoC for this wonderful project. 

## Notes

You can run many using the default github codespace -- just add

```sh
sudo apt update
```

# for lua

```sh
sudo apt install lua5.1 luajit luarocks rlwrap 
sudo luarocks install penlight
```

# for elixir

```sh
wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_2.0_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_2.0_all.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install elixir
```
